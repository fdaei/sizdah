# Asset Manifest

Every asset the design requires, with its Figma node ID, target path, and export settings.

> **Why this is a manifest and not a folder of files.**
> The build environment used to author this codebase has no outbound network access, so it
> could not download binaries from Figma's CDN. Every asset below is listed with the exact
> node ID and export settings needed to pull it yourself. The code references the **final
> local paths**, so once you run the export step the app is wired up correctly — there are
> no temporary Figma URLs anywhere in the source.

---

## 0. Bulk export (do this first)

Figma MCP asset URLs expire ~7 days after generation, so export from the Figma UI rather
than from stale links.

### Option A — Figma UI (recommended)

1. Open the file, switch to page **`User interface`**.
2. Select the node listed in each row below (`Cmd/Ctrl + P` → paste node ID, or use the
   layers panel).
3. In the right sidebar → **Export**, set the format/scale from the table.
4. Export into the **Target path** given.

### Option B — Figma REST API

```bash
export FIGMA_TOKEN="figd_your_personal_access_token"
export FILE_KEY="HuuGewZFHRm2ekVUFPDQhR"

# Returns a JSON map of nodeId -> temporary download URL
curl -H "X-Figma-Token: $FIGMA_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.figma.com/v1/images/$FILE_KEY?ids=1419:9193,1419:9229&format=png&scale=2"
```

A ready-made script that walks this entire manifest is at `scripts/export-figma-assets.sh`.

Export as **SVG**, they are pure line art and scale to full-bleed backgrounds.

| Node ID | Asset | Target path | Used on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `951:3589` | Concentric arc rings | `resources/images/decor/arc-rings.svg` | About hero backdrop |

## 9. Icons

Remaining UI icons (phone, pin, mail, users, calendar, chevron, arrow, external-link,
Instagram, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, X, YouTube) are **not bespoke** in the file — they are
standard Lucide glyphs. They are provided by the `lucide-vue-next` package already in
`package.json`; do not export these from Figma.

## 10. Fonts — ACTION REQUIRED

| Family | Locales | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Poppins** | `en` | Google Fonts (OFL) | Self-hosted; download script provided |
| **Doran FaNum** | `fa`, `ar` | Commercial licence | **Supplied** — `public/fonts/doran/*.ttf` |
| **Idealist** | all | Commercial licence | **Supplied** — `public/fonts/idealist/Idealist-Models.ttf` |

> **Idealist was missed by the original audit.** The file sets it on every
> section eyebrow (`small title`, 24/400 gold) and on the package price lines —
> 56 text nodes in total, across every page. It is a third family, distinct from
> both Poppins and Doran. It is now declared in `resources/css/fonts.css` and
> applied through the `.eyebrow` component class in `resources/css/app.css`.

`Doran FaNum` is not freely distributable and could not be fetched by the build
environment. Until the licensed files are placed, FA/AR locales fall back to
`Vazirmatn` (OFL, near-identical metrics) via the CSS fallback chain already configured
in `resources/css/fonts.css`.

Place licensed files here:

```
public/fonts/doran/DoranFaNum-Regular.woff2
public/fonts/doran/DoranFaNum-Medium.woff2
public/fonts/doran/DoranFaNum-Bold.woff2
```

The `@font-face` declarations are already written and reference exactly these paths.
Fetch the free fonts with:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-fonts.sh
```

## 10b. Exported via the REST API

These were pulled straight from the file with the `/v1/images` endpoint and are
committed. Re-run the same call with the node ID to refresh any of them.

| Node ID | Asset | Format | Target path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1061:2133` | Goal-card trend icon (gold, 2px stroke) | SVG | `public/icons/sahra/goal.svg` |
| `951:3598` | About hero arch-sculpture cutout | PNG 2× | `public/images/sahra/about-hero-sculpture.png` |
| `1027:2062` | 404 horizon artwork | PNG 2× | `public/images/sahra/404-horizon.png` |
| `453:878` (fill) | Contact card background | PNG | `public/images/sahra/contact-bg.png` |

The Contact background is an *image fill*, not a renderable node — resolve it
through `/v1/files/$FILE_KEY/images` using the fill's `imageRef` rather than
`/v1/images`.

anything missing.
