# Sizdah Marketing

Multilingual (EN/FA/AR) marketing website — Laravel 11 · Inertia 2 · Vue 3 ·
TypeScript · Tailwind · Filament 3.

Built against the `SahraMarketing` Figma file, page `User interface` (`1:2`).
See `docs/FIGMA-AUDIT.md` for the full design audit and
`docs/TRACEABILITY.md` for the node → route → component → model → admin
resource mapping.

---

## 1. Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- Composer 2
- Node 20+
- MySQL 8 or PostgreSQL 14+
- A queue-capable cache (database driver works fine for development)

## 2. Installation

```bash
composer install
npm install

cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Point DB_* in .env at your database, then:
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed

php artisan storage:link
```

Fetch the openly-licensed webfonts (Poppins + Vazirmatn fallback):

```bash
chmod +x scripts/fetch-fonts.sh
./scripts/fetch-fonts.sh
```

> **Doran FaNum** (the Persian/Arabic typeface specified by the Figma
> variables) is commercially licensed and is **not** included. FA/AR render
> with Vazirmatn until you place the licensed files — see
> `docs/ASSET-MANIFEST.md` §10. No code change is needed once they're in place.

Export the real images/logos/icons from Figma per `docs/ASSET-MANIFEST.md`,
then verify nothing is missing:

```bash
php artisan sizdah:verify-assets
```

## 3. Running locally

```bash
composer run dev
```

This runs the PHP server, queue listener, and Vite dev server together
(`concurrently`). Or run them separately:

```bash
php artisan serve
php artisan queue:listen
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` — it redirects to `/en` (or your browser's
preferred supported language).

Admin panel: `http://localhost:8000/admin`. The seeder creates an initial
admin account:

```
email:    admin@sahra.example   (or ADMIN_EMAIL in .env)
password: ChangeMe!2026          (or ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env)
```

**Change this password immediately.** Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` /
`ADMIN_NAME` in `.env` before your first `db:seed` on a real environment to
avoid the default ever existing.

## 4. Testing

```bash
php artisan test              # Pest: locale routing, publication states,
                               # forms, admin authorization
npm run typecheck              # vue-tsc, strict mode
npm run test:e2e               # Playwright — requires the app running;
                               # set BASE_URL if not http://localhost:8000
```

## 5. Production build & deployment

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
npm run build

php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan event:cache

php artisan migrate --force
```

Queue worker (contact-form email notifications run through the queue):

```bash
php artisan queue:work --tries=3
```

Scheduler (promotes scheduled content, regenerates the sitemap — see
`routes/console.php`). Add one cron entry:

```
* * * * * cd /path-to-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Environment checklist for production:

- [ ] `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`
- [ ] `APP_URL` set to the real domain (used for canonical URLs, sitemaps, hreflang)
- [ ] `SESSION_DRIVER`, `CACHE_STORE`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION` pointed at real
      backends (Redis recommended over `database` at scale)
- [ ] `MAIL_*` configured; `CONTACT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` set to a monitored inbox
- [ ] `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set to real values **before** the first
      production `db:seed`
- [ ] Doran FaNum licensed files placed in `public/fonts/doran/` (optional but
      recommended for design fidelity)
- [ ] All 44 assets in `docs/ASSET-MANIFEST.md` exported and
      `php artisan sizdah:verify-assets` passes
- [ ] `storage:link` run so `public/storage` resolves

## 7. Known limitations

See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-LOG.md` § Known limitations for the full list.
In short: dependencies were never installed in the authoring environment (no
network access there), `Doran FaNum` requires a separate licence, binary
assets are a manifest pending manual export, and the Vue page components
(`resources/js/Pages/*.vue`) are the next concrete unit of work — the full
data layer they'll consume (routes, controllers, transformers, seeded
content, TypeScript contracts) is complete and covered by tests today.
